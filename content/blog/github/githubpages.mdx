description: Setting up Github Pages
---

You can build a static site and have it hosted on GitHub Pages with a few configurations to the codebase and the github repository’s settings. 

This example expects that you are using npm for your development/deployment

## Setup
1. Create a new repo in Github
  - Make sure that it's a `Public` repo

2. Install the [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) npm package
  - Install gh-pages:
    ```sh
    $ npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```
  - Add a build/deploy script to your `package.json`
    ```js
    "scripts": {
      "build": "some-build-script",
      "predeploy": "rm -rf ./public",
      "deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d public"
    }
    ```
  - The `-d public` you're telling `gh-pages` where the build source code lives
  - When you run npm run deploy all contents of the `public` folder will be moved to your repository’s gh-pages branch. 
  - **note**: *With npm scripts if you prefix the scripts key name with `pre` it will run before the command and `post` it will run after*

3. Update setting for GithubPages 
  - You must select which branch will be deployed from your repository settings in GitHub for GitHub Pages to function. 
  - The nice thing about the `gh-pages` npm package is that it will create a `gh-pages` branch and wire it up for you
  - Navigate to your repo then click [`Settings` > Scroll down to the `GitHub Pages` Section]

  - It's ok to keep the path as `/ (root)` because the when you run `gh-pages -d public` it take the contents of the `public` folder and saves it to the root of the `gh-pages` branch


## Publishing to GitHub Pages
- All you need to do to publish to githubpages is to run the npm `deploy` script
  ```sh
  $ npm run deploy
  ```
- Your static page should live: https://`<GITHUB_USERNAME>`.github.io/`<REPO_NAME>`/.
- *You might have to clear your cache to see the new changes*
