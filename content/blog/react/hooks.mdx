- Prior to 16.8 React developers had to use `classes` to take advantage of certain react features
- State (data that changes in a component) lives in a class constructor
- You can still use `classes` in react but hooks allows you to write less code
- React built-in Hooks:
  1. `useState`
  2. `useEffect`
  3. `useContext`
  4. `useReducer`
  5. `useCallback`
  6. `useMemo`
  7. `useRef`
  8. `useImperativeHandle`
  9. `useLayoutEffect`
  10. `useDebug`

- Hooks all start with `use`


# useState



# useEffect
- ties into the lifecycle of the React component


```
componentDidMount(){}
componentDidUpdate(){}
componentDidUnmount(){}

```




```js

```
