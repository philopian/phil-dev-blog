# Using `@testing-library/react`

- [](https://www.polvara.me/posts/five-things-you-didnt-know-about-testing-library/)
1. Everything is a DOM node
  - Many think that getByText and other helper methods return some special wrapper around the React component.
  - When you work with Testing Library you are dealing with DOM nodes.



```js
import React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";

test("everything is a node", () => {
  const Foo = () => <div>Hello</div>;
  render(<Foo />);
  expect(screen.getByText("Hello")).toBeInstanceOf(Node);
  expect(screen.getByText("Heeeello")).toBeNull(); // Test to see if NOT present
});

```
