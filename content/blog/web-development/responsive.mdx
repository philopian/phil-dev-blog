# Font size
- pixels, relative to a container(em), & relative to the document (rem)
- Pixels are 

- If you wanna go "retro, sustain the norms because you know what works already and as long as it works stand on your lawn and share your fist vigorously"
- This is the use for pixels being used within HTML & CSS
- We now have a variety of differnent screensizes to view our webpages
- Font size does not specifically correlate to pixels on screen size
- All font units in CSS (including px) are capable of handling floats in modern browsers

- rem = "root" em


# Overview
- `EM` relative to parent's container, however sometimes results in undesired compounding
- `REM` relative to the document
- em & rem helps to make your elements responsively scale

```css
/* you can define the base font-size in the `::root` or `html` selector*/

::root{
  font-size: 16px; /* 16px is generally the browser default size*/
}
html {
  font-size: 16px; /* 16px is generally the browser default size*/
}
```


- example of `em`:
  ```css
  html {
    font-size: 16px; /* 16px is generally the browser default size*/
  }

  .container {
    font-size: 25px; /*This will compound the children based on this value */
  }
  h1 {
    font-size: 2.5em;
  }
  p{
    font-size: 1em;
  }
  ```

- example of `rem`:
  ```css
  html {
    font-size: 16px; /* 16px is generally the browser default size*/
  }

  .container {
    font-size: 25px; /*This will NOT compound the child font-sizes */
  }
  h1 {
    font-size: 2.5rem;
  }
  p{
    font-size: 1rem;
  }
  ```



# You don't have to use these units just for fonts
- When you use them for margin and padding
- The margin/padding is looking at it's element's font-size, not the parent or document
  ```css
  p{
    font-size: 2.5em;
    margin: 1em; /* This margins is equal to the font-size of 2.5em */
  }
  ```
- REM ALWAYS LOOKING AT THE ROOT
- it might be best to use em for scaling different versions of your






# Float, flexbox, grids
